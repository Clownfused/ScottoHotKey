Order Helper by Scott Rippey

Programming Guide:
------------------

Required Files and Folders:
---------------------------
AutoHotKey\Start Up\Work\Order Helper\*.*
AutoHotKey\Start up\#Includes\*.*

Intro
------------------
The Order Helper program is an AutoHotKey script that is distributed over a number of files and folders.
To run or compile the script, use AutoHotKey to open "Order Helper Compiler.exclude.ahk".
If you add or remove any files from the program, you will need to reopen "Order Helper Compiler.exclude.ahk".







The script is split into several directories: Data, GUI, Integration, and Misc


The "Data" folder
-------------------
Contains files of data, such as a list of products, peachtree accounts, sales reps, etc... and code for using that data.
If you want to edit any of these data files, you should pay close attention to the format of the data, because the text is usually in a very specific format.


The "GUI" folder
--------------------
This contains all the GUI elements and all logic for updating the GUI.  
"Orders GUI 1.ahk" contains all the GUI elements, and layout, and pre-processing and post-processing.
"Orders GUI 2.ahk" contains all the GUI code, such as credit card validation and automatic text advancing.


The "Integration" folder
-------------------------
This folder contains all code for integrating between the Order Helper and other applications.  
This includes www.griffinlab.com (osCommerce), Virtual Merchant, Peachtree, and ACT!.

The "Standalone Project Files (exclude)" folder
----------------------------------------------
The only reason this is here is to allow compatibility between the Order Helper and another application I developed, "ClipboardQueue".  Normally, Order Helper is part of my "Main Script" that uses the ClipboardQueue, but if the Order Helper needs to be compiled on its own, it needs these files.


The "Misc" folder
-------------------------
The rest of the files go here.  Currently there is only the Ctrl+R Reload function.







Programming Tips
---------------------
All the values on an order window are stored globally.  Therefore, there should not be more than 1 Order Helper window at a time.  If you decide to have 2 windows, do so at your own risk.  Whichever window hits "Apply" last will affect Import/Export operations, and if a window is closed, it will probably be cleared.
